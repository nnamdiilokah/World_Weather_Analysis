# World_Weather_Analysis
**Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide**

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to retrieve and anlayze data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip, using Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.
Firstly, a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes will be generated, the nearest city will be retrieved, and an API call performed with the OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the weather description for each city. 
Furthermore, input statements will be created to filter the data for weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Four cities will be chosen from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. 
Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route will be created between the four cities and a marker layer map.
